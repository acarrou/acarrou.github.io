*Astraeus-I:*

Built a flight computer for a high-altitude rocket. The board integrates sensors and modules on an ARM Cortex-M class MCU, supporting sensor acquisition, logging, and fault handling for avionics applications.

*Libhal:*

Contributing to libhal, an open-source embedded hardware abstraction layer. The library provides a unified API for hardware interfaces (GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART, ADC), enabling portable embedded C/C++ code across different processors and platforms. Developed drivers for the libhal ecosystem to support bring-up and validation on various embedded targets.
