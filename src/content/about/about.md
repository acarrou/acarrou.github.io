I’m a passionate engineer driven by the thrill of blending hardware and software into groundbreaking solutions. My work spans embedded systems architecture, advanced PCB design, firmware optimization, and smart IoT/robotics integration each project fueled by the desire to create technology that truly matters. I love the challenge of taking intricate specifications and transforming them into elegant, efficient hardware matched with robust firmware, constantly pushing boundaries to exceed performance goals.

Currently, I’m immersed in the space industry, working on cutting edge aerospace technologies that demand precision and reliability. At the same time, I’m exploring the world of medical device engineering, inspired by the opportunity to directly improve people’s lives through inventive design. No matter the domain, I bring a creative, problem solving mindset to ensure every system I craft is both powerful and purposeful.

Outside of work, I channel my engineering curiosity into personal passion projects—tinkering, prototyping, and contributing to open-source embedded projects. I'm actively interested in teaching and mentorship, drawing on my experience leading student teams in robotics and CubeSat projects at SJSU. I'm currently seeking part-time teaching opportunities in computer science and computer engineering. When I'm not working on projects, traveling with my girlfriend and friends helps me explore new cultures and spark fresh ideas.

**Interests:** Teaching/mentorship in CS and embedded systems | Open-source embedded development | Aerospace systems
