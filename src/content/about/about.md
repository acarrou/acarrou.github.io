I am deeply passionate about building and creating innovative solutions. With extensive experience in embedded systems, PCB design, firmware development, and IoT/robotics, I bring a comprehensive and versatile skill set to every project. My particular interest lies in embedded systems, hardware design, and firmware development, where I enjoy tackling complex challenges and optimizing performance.

In my free time, I enjoy running, climbing, and playing video games, which help me stay active and mentally sharp, fueling my creativity and problem-solving skills.
