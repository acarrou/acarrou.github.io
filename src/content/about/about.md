I’m a passionate engineer driven by the thrill of blending hardware and software into groundbreaking solutions. My work spans embedded systems architecture, advanced PCB design, firmware optimization, and smart IoT/robotics integration each project fueled by the desire to create technology that truly matters. I love the challenge of taking intricate specifications and transforming them into elegant, efficient hardware matched with robust firmware, constantly pushing boundaries to exceed performance goals.

Currently, I’m immersed in the space industry, working on cutting edge aerospace technologies that demand precision and reliability. At the same time, I’m exploring the world of medical device engineering, inspired by the opportunity to directly improve people’s lives through inventive design. No matter the domain, I bring a creative, problem solving mindset to ensure every system I craft is both powerful and purposeful.

Outside of work, I channel my engineering curiosity into personal passion projects tinkering, prototyping, and occasionally open sourcing my ideas. I also love blowing off steam through competitive video gaming with friends; there’s nothing like intense matches to sharpen strategic thinking. Traveling with my girlfriend and friends allows me to explore new cultures, broaden my viewpoint, and spark fresh innovation. These experiences both in and out of the lab keep me motivated to forge solutions that benefit our ever-evolving world.
